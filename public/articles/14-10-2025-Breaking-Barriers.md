## Breaking Barriers: Women Leading the Way in Maryland's Construction Industry

The construction industry has long been seen as a male-dominated space — but that narrative is changing fast in Maryland. More women than ever are picking up hard hats, leading crews, managing projects, and even running their own construction firms across the state.

### Rising Through the Ranks

Across Maryland, women are taking on key roles in construction — not just in administration, but on-site and in leadership positions. From project managers in Baltimore to crane operators in Frederick, their presence is not only growing but reshaping the industry’s culture.

One notable example is **Marissa Grant**, who started as a site engineer and now owns one of the fastest-growing commercial construction firms in Montgomery County. Stories like hers are becoming more common as companies recognize the value of a diverse workforce.

### Supporting Women in the Trades

Organizations like **NAWIC Baltimore (National Association of Women in Construction)** and **Maryland’s Women in Trades Network** are providing critical support — offering mentorship, apprenticeships, scholarships, and advocacy. These groups play a vital role in creating pathways for women to enter and thrive in the industry.

### Challenges Still Exist

Despite the progress, women in construction still face obstacles — including wage gaps, limited access to leadership roles, and workplace bias. However, many Maryland companies are taking proactive steps to address these issues by implementing inclusive hiring practices, providing harassment training, and promoting from within.

### Building an Inclusive Future

As the demand for skilled labor continues to grow in Maryland, the inclusion of women in the construction workforce isn’t just a diversity goal — it’s an economic necessity. By supporting women through training, leadership opportunities, and equitable pay, the state’s construction industry is building more than just structures — it’s building a better future.
